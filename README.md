A 99% graded data analysis project on email data.

I applied advanced data cleansing and text analysis techniques to uncover patterns within a set of rejection and non-rejection emails. 

Leveraging my experience in data preprocessing, I refined token data using lowercasing, stopword removal, and frequency analysis. This enabled a deeper understanding of linguistic trends, including sentence structure, token distributions, and sentiment. 

Key insights included the strong correlation between rejection emails and apologetic language, as well as the high frequency of phrases like "Thank you" in rejectionsâ€”revealing subtle but consistent patterns in communication tone and structure.
